## About

aos is a command-line app that connects to your `aos` Process on the ao Permaweb Computer Grid. The ao Computer Grid, is like the internet, but for compute. Each Process on the Grid can receive messages and send messages. This cli will allow you to pass LUA expressions to your Process, and those expressions get evaluated and return output to your system.
